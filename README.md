![views]

I'm JosÃ© Gabriel (he/him), a self-taught programming enthusiast. Most of my spare time is reading and researching stuff, being a very curious person about how things work.

Currently learning Rust, compilers and interpreters.

I also like to meet new people, so feel free to [reach me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-gabriel-43a385214/) if you need!
